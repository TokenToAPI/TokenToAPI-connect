# Verification Notes

Verification date: 2026-10-07 (first verification for v0.1.0; the English-language v0.1.0 release was re-verified and passed on 2026-10-08). Earlier internal iterations were not published as public releases.

> **TokenToAPI Connect note (2026-10-07)**: this project's configuration engine, client adaptation, and test logic
> originate from CC Switch's open-source configuration engine (MIT licensed, see [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md)), and it has fully
> adopted the TokenToAPI brand — the default gateway is [https://tokentoapi.com](https://tokentoapi.com)
> (a `/v1` gateway); the app icon, name, identifier, storage directory, and colors all use TokenToAPI's official brand
> (T2A Emerald / Sky). The models available from the default site are whatever the TokenToAPI gateway's `/v1/models` actually returns.

## Automated tests

- macOS / Apple Silicon: 54 Rust configuration tests and 10 frontend state tests pass; the TypeScript check and the frontend production build pass.
- Configuration tests cover preserving the original restore point after multiple imports, exact restoration of an existing authentication file, reverting a newly created file, comment preservation, rejecting a stale preview, confirming later edits, interrupted-operation recovery, corrupted configuration, file locks, and paths containing non-ASCII characters and spaces.
- Model discovery tests use a loopback address to mock the gateway with fake keys, checking authentication, redirect rejection, model selection, and binding of the fetch results, without calling any real inference endpoint.
- The Windows-specific configuration test code includes `.cmd` launcher and AppData path checks and has been cross-compiled. The automated tests above were run on macOS.

## Artifact checks

- The macOS UI passed isolated import, restore, light/dark theme, and small-window checks. The public release unifies the version identity and the packaging method.
- Windows x64 EXE checks cover the PE architecture, GUI subsystem, 0.1.0 version resources, app icon, `asInvoker` permissions, and system DLL imports. No external VC++ or WebView2Loader DLL is required; the actual UI still needs the system WebView2 Runtime.
- The Mac package is checked for arm64, the 0.1.0 app version, and the ad-hoc signature; the ZIPs for both platforms are checked for CRC, archiver, and build artifact consistency, and SHA-256 is provided.

## Scope of verification

Missing WebView2, organization policy control, all client versions, and all combinations of model tool calls remain unverified item by item. Supporting a configuration format does not mean covering every historical client version, every gateway protocol, or every model capability.

The Windows release package is not yet signed. The Mac release package has not yet completed Apple Developer ID signing and notarization. The testing and packaging process does not modify real Claude / Codex configuration.
